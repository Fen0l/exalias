## Features

This app comes some features:
* Exchange 2013, 2016 OVH

## Installation

To be able to use it, you have to create an Application API. You can check a ticket on my website [First step with the OVH API][ovh_api_blog].
To prevent a maximum against hackers, you will provide a restricted access. Just enough for the app.

```
curl -XPOST -H"X-Ovh-Application: Ã€PP_KEY" -H "Content-type: application/json" \
 https://eu.api.ovh.com/1.0/auth/credential  -d '{
     "accessRules": [
         {
             "method": "GET",
             "path": "/email/exchange*"
         },
         {
             "method": "POST",
             "path": "/email/exchange/*/service/*/account/*/alias*"
         },
         {
            "method": "DELETE",
             "path": "/email/exchange/*/service/*/account/*/alias*"
         }
     ],
     "redirection":"https://anthonypradal.com/"
}'
```
